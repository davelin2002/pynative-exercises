# Pynative Practice Problem Attempts

- most of the problems include an attempt that was made that was changed afterwards to match the requirements listed on the website
- tests are partially copy-pasted from the website when a test case was given along with some of my own for verification
- I won't always consider ALL edge cases for the interests of time and simply practicing so keep this in mind
